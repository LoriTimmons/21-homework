  ## Description
  This project is refactoring a Google Books API built with RESTful API to a GraphQL API built with an Apollo Server. I have utilized the MERN stack to complete this task. 

  ## Installation
  * Set up Apollo Server with GraphQl
  

  ## Usage
 The Google Book API will allow you perform a term search, allow a user to save books and host a section where a user can access their saved items.
